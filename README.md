# Histogram-Stretch

#Note: make sure you have OpenCV, matplot, and tkinter installed!!!

#HOW TO RUN:
#1. Make sure the picture you want to process is in the same location main.py is.
#2. Run main.py.
#3. Add the name of the file (with the extension as well) in the textbox. e.g. 'baboon.png'.
#4. Click the 'Enter' button.
#5. Click other buttons at your choosing - pay attention to messages printed out to IDLE

#All steps should work except step 6 due to being unclear on how to actually implement this
#Steps 3 and 4 may be wrong in implementation but I believe the method and thought process is there

#BUGS:
#None to report
